<p class="ParrafoM">From 2008 to 2010, I participated in the 2010 Solar Decathlon Competition along with a team of students composed of fellow architects and students from other majors. I had the opportunity to visit previous entries at U.T. &amp; Texas A&amp;M as well to be an expectator in the 2009 Solar Decathlon Competition held in Washington DC. We developed the project inside the Academic program of Innovation at ITESM.. </p>
<h2 class="Header2"><img src="aster.png" alt="aster" width="26" height="25" hspace="0" vspace="0" /> About the Experience</h2>
<p class="ParrafoM">When you  are in college, the most memorable moments are not the moments spent at class  but the extra-curricular projects that give students a chance to relate to  others.<br />
  It was  project on which we developed a prototype of a home fed by solar energy.<br />
  For 2  years I had the opportunity to work and share with the best people. It all  began in 2008 with the idea of my friend Lily of participating on the contest.  I accepted the invitation and among several friends send our submittal, which was  accepted.<br />
  We  started the project by asking for help from the school faculty and got a green  light to develop the project as part of our school activities by sharing special  for the development of the innovative house. <br />
  We had  the opportunity to work in multi-disciplinary team of Civil Engineers,  Architects, Mechanical engineers and Physics to develop the project and  received a lot of help from all the faculty of our school.</p>
