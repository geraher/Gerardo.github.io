  <span class="ParrafoM">Working under my advisor, Dr. Amit Varma, at the Bowen Laboratory a large-scale civil engineering research center.<br />
  Part of a team of graduate students visualizing experiments to test Modular Steel Plate Composites specimens. <br />
  Use my drafting experience to visualize possible layouts and configurations to test connections for shear walls and coupling beams. <br />
  Participated in the construction and testing of various composite specimens.</span><br />
  Architect<br />

  Design and construction documents for warehouse, guardhouses and workers facilities using Tilt-up Concrete construction.<br />
  MEP and Construction Documents for offices inside the industrial buildings<br />
  Documentation for LEED accreditation of buildings.<br />
  From this experience what I learn was to work in an ordered way and generate parametric tools through the CAD and BIM documents in order to handle the huge load of construction documents required for all the industrial parks. <br />
The commitment of the developer for LEED construction inspired me to pursue my LEED AP credential.</span></p>
