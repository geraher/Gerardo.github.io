<h2 class="Header2"><span class="CVGreen"><img src="aster.png" width="26" height="25" alt="aster" /></span>Personal Statement</h2>
<p class="ParrafoM">Experienced Professional with Architecture and Structural Engineering formal training. Eight years of experience in Design and Engineering for Sustainable Construction. Seeking new opportunities in the US to gain further experience and knowledge in Structural Engineering. Passionate about integrating new technologies that enrich project aesthetics and reduce costs. </p>
<h2 class="Header2"><span class="CVGreen"><img src="aster.png" width="26" height="25" alt="aster" /></span>Bio</h2>
<p class="ParrafoM">I was born  April 26 1988 in Culiacan, Sinaloa. My father is a doctor and my mother is a schoolteacher.  I have 2 brothers, Luis who is a mechanical engineer &amp; Alex who is an  economist.<br />
  I spent all  my childhood until adulthood in Culiacan, I have only peaceful memories in  contrast into what is portrayed in the news. Our parents raised us in a  separate world which I think help us grew secure of ourselves and considering  family as the most important.<br />
  In 2006, I  moved to Monterrey to pursuit my architectural studies in a house with my two  brothers. There I found great freedom to pursuit my interests like music. I was  part of the folk group Raices and traveled the world performing music during  the summers, which is my most memorable experience during that period.<br />
  I also participated  with a multidisciplinary team in the Solar Decathlon edition of 2010, with a  development period of 2 years. Unfortunately, a few months before the  competition, our school could not gather the funds to start construction and we  had to withdraw. Beside that disappointment, the experience still was eye  opening since I learned that even a small house could integrate so much  complexity. One must also has to be a good leader to guarantee the completion  of any ambitious project and provide useful insights for the team, which is also,  why I keep preparing myself constantly. Finally, in 2011 I finished my  architectural studies and was happy to receive a DEXFI award from my  institution for my participation in extracurricular activities.<br />
  After graduation,  I worked as an architect; first in a design studio, then in a construction  company. During that time, I felt that I was not learning what I wanted to  learn about construction, so I left my job and continue my studies; now as a  civil engineer. <br />
  I studied  in U ERRE while working half time; I was lucky since thanks to a friend I found  a half time job as an environmental consultant something I wanted to try since  my experience in the Solar Decathlon competition. It was difficult to manage  both, but I think I organized quite well since I graduated with the best grades  of my faculty class and became a LEED Green Associate.<br />
  I worked  full time in Kalos as a draftsman for industrial project towards LEED  certification. I found it fulfilling since I had the opportunity to work with  the latest software technology like Revit to create construction drawings and  steel detailing for fabrication of metal structures. <br />
In May 2020, I finished my Masterâ€™s in Civil Engineering with a  concentration in Structures at Purdue University!
I'm currently working in the State of Michigan as a Structural Engineer in Gala & Associates and I'm on track to become a PE (just recently I passed the PE civil exam!)</p>
